        <div class="advisory-row">
          <span class="advisory-label">Genuine: </span>
          <span class="advisory-text">Recites only authentic Qur'anic verses and prophetic duʿas, clearly and correctly in Arabic. May explain the meanings to help the patient understand what is being read.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="advisory-row advisory-row--danger">
          <span class="advisory-label advisory-label--danger">False: </span>
          <span class="advisory-text">Mumbles in an unknown language, mixes foreign or "mystical" words, or uses chants that are not from Qur'an or Sunnah. Sometimes uses "secret names" of jinn or angels, coded syllables, or meaningless sounds to hide shirk.</span>

      <div class="advisory-content">
        <div class="advisory-row">
          <span class="advisory-label">Genuine: </span>
          <span class="advisory-text">Respects Islamic guidelines — does not touch or physically interact with non-mahram women. Keeps a professional and modest distance.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="advisory-row advisory-row--danger">
          <span class="advisory-label advisory-label--danger">False: </span>
          <span class="advisory-text">Suggests touching a woman as part of "treatment" — even if he appears to be an old sheikh with a white beard and a calm, holy demeanour. This is a major red flag. Such men exploit women at their most vulnerable. Do not confront this snake — just leave. In some cases, touching is used as a cover for sexual abuse or transferring sihr/jinn contact.</span>

          <span class="advisory-label">Genuine: </span>
          <span class="advisory-text">Never claims to know the unseen, the future, or hidden personal matters. Makes assessments only from what is visible or what the patient shares.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="advisory-row advisory-row--danger">
          <span class="advisory-label advisory-label--danger">False: </span>
          <span class="advisory-text">Claims special knowledge — predicting the future, telling you hidden details about your life, or describing events they could not naturally know. This is usually through communication with jinn, who pass information in exchange for acts of shirk and filth. These can include desecrating the Qur'an, engaging in immoral acts, or performing rituals for the jinn's benefit.</span>

          <span class="advisory-label advisory-label--danger">False: </span>
          <span class="advisory-text">Requests strange or impossible items — such as a black bird, three-legged goat, or rare herbs with no Islamic basis. Asks for personal items you've worn or touched, especially intimate clothing (e.g., underwear) or hair/nails. This is a well-known magician tactic, often used to create or strengthen sihr against the victim.</span>

          <span class="advisory-label advisory-label--danger">False: </span>
          <span class="advisory-text">Gives such items and claims they will protect or heal you. Often these contain squares, numbers, and symbols with no meaning in Arabic; names of unknown "spirits" or "angels" (often jinn); verses of Qur'an written backwards or mixed with strange symbols; knots, threads, powders, or animal parts used in occult rituals; and instructions to burn, bury, dissolve in water and drink, or hang at certain locations. Such practices are forbidden and often involve cooperation with jinn. A genuine raqi will tell you to destroy these items safely (e.g., by soaking in water until the ink fades, then disposing respectfully).</span>

          <span class="advisory-text">Boasts of "special powers" or unique status. Orders the patient to isolate for days, remain in darkness, or avoid all human contact without Islamic proof. Such isolation is often a way to break the patient's mental resilience and make them more suggestible.</span>
